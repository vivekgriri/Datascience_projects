<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The "National Childcare Affordability Crisis" project is a social-economic data study aimed at uncovering the financial strain placed on American families by rising childcare costs. While many families feel the "pinch" of monthly expenses, this project quantifies that struggle by mapping childcare prices against median household incomes across different U.S. counties.

The project was born from a need to provide evidence-based storytelling. Instead of just looking at raw numbers, it translates data into a narrative that moves from a broad national overview to specific, high-impact regional crises. By highlighting the gap between what families earn and what childcare actually costs, the project serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying where government subsidies and policy changes are needed most.


### Built With
* Python Programming using Jupiter Notebook
* pandas
* seaborn module
* matplotlib


### Data
The analysis is built upon the National Database of Childcare Prices, the most comprehensive federal source of local-level childcare price data.

__Key Focus Areas:__ Analyzed the costs of three specific care types: Infant, Toddler, and Preschool care.

__Economic Benchmarks:__ To measure "affordability," these costs were compared against the Median Household Income (MHI) of the respective regions.

__Scope:__ The dataset covers multiple years and thousands of counties, allowing for a look at how geography dictates a family's financial health.


### Method of Analysis
To make this data understandable for the public and policymakers, I used a structured analytical pipeline:

__Data Aggregation:__ I consolidated 6-month price averages to smooth out monthly fluctuations and provide a stable view of costs.

__Comparative Visualization:__ Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn), I created grouped visualizations that rank the most expensive states and care types. This immediately identifies "hotspots" where infant care costs significantly more than preschool care.

__Narrative Strategy:__  Organized the results into three layers: a Presentation for high-level summaries, an Infographic for quick economic impact facts, and a Dashboard for interactive, granular exploration.


### Summary 

The core finding of this project is that the childcare crisis is spatially uneven. In many regions, the cost of infant care alone consumes a disproportionate percentage of a family's take-home pay. By presenting this data visually, the project empowers advocacy groups and state leaders to move from "recognizing a problem" to "designing a solution," such as targeted subsidies for high-cost infant care.
