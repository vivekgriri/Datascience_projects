<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

__Objective:__ Multi-class classification of obesity levels.

__Process:__ Handled a mixed dataset of 23% survey data and 77% synthetically generated data.

__Impact:__ Identifies "non-medical" predictors of health outcomes, highlighting the business value for health-tech and insurance industries.


### Built With
* Python Programming using Jupiter Notebook
* pandas
* seaborn module
* matplotlib

### Summary 

__The Data:__ This project utilizes a specialized dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, focusing on individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. It tracks the dietary habits, physical activity levels, and physical conditions of 498 participants. Key variables include:

__Eating Habits:__ Frequency of high-caloric food consumption, vegetable intake, number of main meals, and alcohol consumption.

__Physical Activity:__ Frequency of physical exercise, time spent using electronic devices, and primary mode of transportation.

__Demographics:__ Age, gender, weight, height, and family history of being overweight.

__Method of Analysis:__ The primary goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts an individual's obesity level based on their daily behaviors. The analysis followed these steps:

__Data Preparation:__ The data was balanced and normalized to ensure accuracy, using techniques like SMOTE to handle segments of the population that were underrepresented in the original survey.

__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Investigated the statistical relationships between habits (like water consumption and physical activity) and their direct impact on body mass index (BMI).

__Predictive Modeling:__ I evaluated several algorithms to determine which could most accurately classify an individual into one of seven weight categories, ranging from "Insufficient Weight" to "Obesity III".

__The Findings and Value:__ The analysis aims to provide a tool for early detection. For a public audience, this means:

__Personal Awareness:__ Helping individuals identify which specific habits are putting them at the highest risk.

__Healthcare Optimization:__ Allowing health insurance providers and medical professionals to create targeted incentive programs for healthy eating and exercise, ultimately reducing the incidence of obesity-related diseases like heart disease and diabetes.
